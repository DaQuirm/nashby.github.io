Hey! My name is Vasiliy Ermolovich and I'm Software Engineer from Minsk, Belarus. I love open source software and I contribute to some projects I use regularly:

 - I'm [#114 Rails commiter](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/vasiliy-ermolovich/commits).
 - I'm contributor to such popular gems as [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/commits?author=nashby), [SimpleForm](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form/commits?author=nashby), [Enumerize](https://github.com/brainspec/enumerize/commits?author=nashby), etc. You can find more on my [github profile](https://github.com/nashby).

From time to time I'm working on fun projects as [Jos√© vs OSS](https://github.com/nashby/jose-vs-oss). It's Google Chrome and Firefox extension that adds 6 additional buttons to help [@josevalim](http://github.com/josevalim) manage open source projects on GitHub. And it is (was) working. You can check out [this presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/nashby/jose-vs-oss) to get the idea of what impact it had.

Also I love helping people on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/336626/vasiliy-ermolovich?tab=profile).
